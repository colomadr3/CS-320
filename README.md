How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?    
It is important to start with a good foundation. Ensuring that I understand the requirements and expectations allows me to better prepare. Taking time to plan and diagram the program before coding will help to see how it will be developed. Testing will be the next step after coding to ensure that the program is functioning as intended. Testing will also allow me to see if my code is secure. By discovering and correcting issues early, I am safeguarding my client and their customers.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Software development requires a lot of planning and preparation. The first part is to determine the client's requirements. This will give structure and guidance to the program. Once that it determined, figuring out how the user will interact with the program will be the next course of action. Understanding the users' expectations while using the program will help to ensure we are working with their best interest. This comes with QA testing and basic logic to keep thing simple and intuitive 

How do I approach designing software?
I feel that I answered this with the first two questions. I take time to plan out the program based on the client requirements. Ideally I would like to progress in an iterative cycle, slowly improving with each version. The important thing to keep in mind is the timeframe, the team, and the expectations.
